# ROS packages for JPL Open Source Rover Gazebo Simulation

## Introduction
This package suite is designed to bring the JPL Open Source Rover to life in a simulated environment using Gazebo. Inspired by [NASA JPL's Open Source Rover project](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover), these packages allow for visualization and control in a Gazebo simulation, offering a versatile platform for educational purposes and beyond.

## Overview
The following ROS packages are included to visualize the rover in rviz and simulate its operations in Gazebo:

- `rover.launch`: Launches a package for observing the rover in rviz, providing real-time visualization of its movements and sensor data.
- `rover_gazebo.launch`: Deploys the rover within the Gazebo simulation environment, creating a virtual testing ground for rover operations.
- `controller.launch`: Initializes the control system for the rover, setting the stage for user interaction through various input devices.
- `rover_teleop_keyboard.launch`: A package that allows the user to maneuver the rover using keyboard inputs, ensuring precise and responsive control.
- `rover_teleop_xbox.launch`: Enables control of the rover via an Xbox controller, offering an intuitive and ergonomic option for navigation and operation.

Each package is crafted to enhance the rover simulation experience, providing users with comprehensive tools for exploration and learning.
